      <p>Washington’s landscape was formed by a violent past.
      <br><br>Smooth cobbles in a roadcut miles from where the river flows today are evidence of a river shaped over millennia.
      <br><br>“The Columbia River we know today is just the most recent version of a river that has a much older history than anything else,” said Nick Zentner, geologist at Central Washington University.
      <br><br>He loves surprising people who think they know the river well — showing them, for instance, these rocks that prove the river used to flow right by Granger, Wash., until lava flows shoved it aside.
      <br><br>“Everyone knows what a river cobble looks like, and there’s thousands and thousands and thousands of these beautiful river cobbles. And there is not a river here,” Zentner said, palming a smooth, gold-hued rock in his hand. </p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Building Grand Coulee Dam was a cornerstone of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal. It promised thousands of jobs, hydropower and irrigation to transform sagebrush to farms. Grand Coulee ever since has been the workhouse of the Federal Columbia River Hydropower System and is still today the largest hydropower producer in the U.S., with four powerhouses in a dam nearly a mile long, and 550 feet high.
      <br><br>Outside the dam’s powerhouses, electricity sizzles and snaps up wires carrying it to eight western states and British Columbia.
      <br><br>Grand Coulee irrigates more than 670,000 acres and generates enough electricity to power about 2 million homes for a year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam.</p>
